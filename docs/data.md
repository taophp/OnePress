# Database

OnePress stores its data in a [Postgreql](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, which is much more powerfull than others open source relational databases. It handles it through [models form Phalcon framework](https://docs.phalconphp.com/3.4/en/db-models) but in its original way, making it greeter. All objects handled by OnePress are childs of the Items class, have a [_UUID_, _Universally Unique Identifier_ (v4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).
