## What is OnePress

**OnePress is currently in its very beginning, unusable.** So, don't expect
it to work. You can have a glimpse of the code and even contribute if you
like. That's all.

OnePress intend to be a CMS of a new kind, built for web agencies, by a web agency.
It's really amazing that no CMS targets this audience nowadays and it is
a real pain for agencies to maintain all those websites,
the way they did most of the time.

With OnePress, web agencies are _first class citizens_.
